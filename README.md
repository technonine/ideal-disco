Descriptions of setting up various installations on linux with the focus of having it all run from a usb

This is basically a storage repo where I will store scripts/instructions for setting up a fully diskencrypted bootable usb.
The goal is to have the install be able to for example run a lamp configuration or allow remote ssh on the pc it is booted from.

FAQ:

Q: Why are you going through all this effort?
A: Because I find it fun to mess around with these things and wonder just how far I can go.

Q: But seriously why are you doing this?
A: because of educational purposes, I wonder how things like these work, and what is a better way of learning than setting something up yourself?

Q: Cool Information, can I make a copy of it and send it to all my friends?
A: sure, this repo is more meant as a collection of my personal notes, you are free to copy them and do with them what you want.

Important: This repo just contains personal notes on how to create certain settups. I do by no means guarantee that the instructions here work or are suitable for any one purpose. Remember anything you do you do at your own risk.
